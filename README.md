rpncalc
=======

A [Reverse Polish notation]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation") based calculator that uses a stack. Written in C, works on command line.

Mostly works, but error handling isn't up to scratch.

Features so far:

* Uses floating point (double data type).
* Operations:
	* Add.
	* Subtract.
	* Multiply.
	* Divide.
	* Raise to power.

Todo:

* Shell like interface (can do multiple calculations without exiting).
* More operations.
* Better error handling.
